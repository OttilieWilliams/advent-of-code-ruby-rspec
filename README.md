# Advent of Code 2021 Template

Template for completing the Advent of Code 2021 using Ruby, with RSpec for testing

## Getting started

Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/OttilieWilliams/advent-of-code-ruby-rspec.git
```

Run bundle install: 

```bash
$ bundle install
```

If you have any issues running bundle install, try adding the following line to either ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:

```bash
eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"
```

To run all the tests, run:

```bash
$ rspec
```

Or to run just one test, run:

```bash
$ rspec spec/{file_name}
```

For example:

```bash
$ rspec spec/day_one_spec.rb
```
